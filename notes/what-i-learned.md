Understanding the L293D Motor Driver

I learned how the L293D works internally, including logic power (pin 16), motor voltage (pin 8), and the four ground pins.

I figured out how to use 1Y/2Y and 3Y/4Y as motor outputs and how 1A/2A/3A/4A control motor direction.

I now understand the importance of shared ground between the Arduino, battery, and L293D.

Wiring Motors and Power Safely

I learned how to wire DC motors so they can be safely powered using a 9V supply without damaging the Arduino.

I practiced clean wiring by mapping each pin back to the schematic.

I realized why motors need a separate voltage source and how the driver isolates them from the Arduino.

Using Tinkercad for Simulation

I learned how to lay out a full circuit in Tinkercad and use the simulation tools to test logic before building real hardware.

I found out how helpful it is to simulate first so mistakes don’t fry components in real life.

Coding Motor Control

I learned how to write Arduino motor code using digitalWrite(), analogWrite(), and pin mapping.

I experimented with enable pins (EN1/EN2) to control motor speed.

I added serial print debugging so I could see what my program was doing while running.

Working With Sensors (IR Line Sensors)

I learned how IR sensors detect light vs. dark surfaces.

I set up sensor pins as inputs and tested their values in the serial monitor.

I wrote logic to interpret sensor readings (line detected vs not detected).

Debugging and Troubleshooting

I learned how to trace wiring problems back to pin numbers.

I used schematics and pin diagrams to fix incorrect connections.

I added comments to my code to stay organized and understand each part.

Project Planning and Version Control

I learned how to organize a robotics project into phases:

Power wiring

Motor wiring

Sensor wiring

Code

Testing
